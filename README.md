# December Design & Development

## Abstract
This repository is for the public website for my software development business, December Design & Development.

## Installation
You can download this repo by using the `git clone` command. After `cd`-ing into the directory on your computer, you can then run `npm install`.

You can run this application locally using the command `npm run develop`. The application will run on port 8000 by default.

## Troubleshooting
This codebase requires at least Node version 18.0.0 in order to run successfully.

2. Create a new Gatsby site with the Portfolio Minimal Starter.

   ```sh
   gatsby new portfolio-minimal https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-starter-portfolio-minimal-theme
   ```

3. Once installed, you can begin developing your site.

   ```sh
   cd portfolio-minimal
   gatsby develop
   ```

4. By default, the Portfolio Minimal Starter has a `content` directory at the root of your Gatsby site. There, you can edit the theme settings as well as add content for your sections. To learn more about it, have a look at the [Readme of Portfolio Minimal](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal/tree/main/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal#readme).
