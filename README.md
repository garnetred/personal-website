# December Design & Development

## Note 
I archived this repository for a few reasons.

1. There are concerns that Gatsby may be in maintenance mode and may no longer be being actively maintained. As such, it no longer made sense for my business website to use Gatsby.
2. I noticed that I had difficulty making quick copy changes after not accessing the codebase for a few months, so realized that a CMS like Wordpress might be a better fit.

As a result, I've moved my [business website](www.decemberdevelopment.com) to Wordpress. 

## Abstract
This repository is for the public website for my software development business, December Design & Development.

## Installation
You can download this repo by using the `git clone` command. After `cd`-ing into the directory on your computer, you can then run `npm install`.

You can run this application locally using the command `npm run develop`. The application will run on port 8000 by default.

## Troubleshooting
This codebase requires at least Node version 18.0.0 in order to run successfully.
