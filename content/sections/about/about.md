I'm December Garnet-Smith, the founder of December Design and Development.

I'm a web engineer with both front-end and full-stack experience. I have experience using WordPress, Vue, React, Node, TypeScript, JavaScript, but I always use whatever tech stack is the best for each project. I value creating inclusive and accessible user experiences. To achieve this, I am always learning more about UX, disability, and inclusivity in order to create a better web for everyone.
