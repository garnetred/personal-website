I'm December Garnet-Smith, the founder of December Design and Development.

I decided to found this software development company so that I could help multiple companies who might need engineering talent rather than one. I'm a web engineer with both front-end and full-stack experience. I have experience using Vue, React, Node, TypeScript, JavaScript, etc. but the tech stack isn't the most important thing. I'm fluid and adaptable and love to learn new things, so I'm always happy to use or learn whatever tech stack is the best for each project. I value creating inclusive and accessible user experiences and am always learning more about UX, disability, and inclusivity in order to create a better web for everyone.
